# Data models

Data models are containers for specific types of Items and contain any number of fields. Each data model represents a table in your database. By default, the title formatter is used to display any existing database table names as human-readable collection titles. 

Data models can be organized in any way that is appropriate for your project. You can architect them platform-specific (e.g., pages of a website), or in a more platform-agnostic way (e.g., raw customers of your business). While there's no right or wrong way to structure your data-model, we recommend keeping your data as agnostic as possible so it is easier to repurpose in the future. In short, learn to see your data as its own asset â€” not only through the lens of your immediate project needs.

The only requirement of a data model is that it must contain a Primary Key field. This field stores a unique value that is used to reference the Data model's items throughout the project.
